#1. Using the for loop, create an R script that will display a 5x5 matrix as shown in
# Figure 1. It must contain vectorA = [1,2,3,4,5] and a 5 x 5 zero matrix.
```{r}
vectorA <- c(1,2,3,4,5)

matrixA <- matrix(0,nrow = 5, ncol =5)

for (i in 1:5)
  for (j in 1:5)
  {
    matrixA[i,j] <- abs (vectorA[i] - vectorA[j])
  }

matrixA
```

# 2. Print the string "*" using for() function. The output should be the same as shown
# in Figure 2.
```{r}
for (i in 1:5) {
  cat(paste0("\"", rep("*", i), "\""), "\n")
}
```

#3. Get an input from the user to print the Fibonacci sequence starting from the 1st input
# up to 500. Use repeat and break statements. Write the R Scripts and its output.
```{r}
begin <- as.integer(readline(prompt = "Enter the number to start the Fibonacci sequence: "))

#Assigning  a value to the object begin, assuming that 4 is the user input. This is only for fixing the knitting problem.
begin <- 4

#Before running the code please remove ( begin <- 4) as you can see above this comment so that you can input your desired number. Thank you.

a <- begin
b <- 0


cat("Fibonacci sequence starting from", begin, ":\n")

# Generate Fibonacci sequence
repeat 
  {
  nextFib <- a + b
  if (nextFib > 500)
  {
    break
  }
  cat(nextFib, " ")
  a <- b
  b <- nextFib
}



```

4a. What is the R script for importing an excel or a csv file? Display the first 6 rows of the dataset? Show your codes and its result

```{r}
# Two commonly used packages for this purpose are readxl for Excel files and readr for CSV files.

# For reading a csv file.
data_shoes <- read.csv("data_shoes.csv", header = TRUE)
head(data_shoes)
```

4b.Create a subset for gender(female and male). How many observations are there in Male? How about in Female? Write the R scripts and its output.
```{r}
data_shoes <- read.csv("data_shoes.csv")
data_shoes

male_subset <- subset(data_shoes,Gender=="M")
male_subset

female_subset <- subset(data_shoes,Gender=="F")
female_subset

totalMale <- nrow(male_subset)
totalMale

totalFemale <- nrow(female_subset)
totalFemale

```

4c. Create a graph for the number of males and females for Household Data. Use plot(),
chart type = barplot. Make sure to place title, legends, and colors. Write the R scripts and
its result.

```{r}
totalMale_Female <- table(data_shoes$Gender)
barplot(totalMale_Female,
        main = "Number of Males and Females",
        xlab = "Gender",
        ylab = "Count",
        col = c("pink", "cornflowerblue"),
        legend.text = rownames(totalMale_Female),
        beside = TRUE)

```


5. The monthly income of Dela Cruz family was spent on the following: 
                                       Food 60 Electricity 10  Savings 5  Miscellaneous  25
                                                                
5a. Create a piechart that will include labels in percentage.Add some colors and title of chart. Write the R scripts and show its output.
```{r}

# Define the data
data <- c(Food = 60, Electricity = 10, Savings = 5, Miscellaneous = 25)

# Calculate percentages and format them as strings
percentages <- paste(round(100 * data / sum(data), 1), "%", sep = "")

# Create a pie chart
pie(data, 
    labels = paste(names(data),
    " (", percentages, ")", sep = ""), 
    col = rainbow(length(data)), 
    main = "Expense Distribution")

# Add a legend
legend("topright",
       names(data), 
       cex = 0.10, 
       fill = rainbow(length(data)))
```


6. 
6a. Check for the structure of the data set using the str() function. Describe what you have seen in the output.

```{r}
data(iris)
str(iris)
```

6b.Create an R object that will contain the mean of the sepal.length, sepal.width,petal.length,and
petal.width. What is the R script and its result?
```{r}
mean_Iris <- c(mean(iris$Sepal.Length), mean(iris$Sepal.Width), mean(iris$Petal.Length), mean(iris$Petal.Width))
mean_Iris



mean_sepal_length <- mean(iris$Sepal.Length)
mean_sepal_width <- mean(iris$Sepal.Width)
mean_petal_length <- mean(iris$Petal.Length)
mean_petal_width <- mean(iris$Petal.Width)

mean_Iris <- data.frame(Sepal_Length = mean_sepal_length,
                        Sepal_Width = mean_sepal_width,
                        Petal_Length = mean_petal_length,
                        Petal_Width = mean_petal_width)
mean_Iris

```
6c. Create a pie chart for the Species distribution. Add title, legends, and colors. Write the R script and its result.

```{r}
species_count <- table(iris$Species)
pie(species_count, labels = species_count, col = rainbow(length(species_count)), main = "Species Distribution")
legend("topright", names(species_count), cex = 0.8, fill = rainbow(length(species_count)))
```
6d.Subset the species into setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Write the R scripts
and show the last six (6) rows of each species.
```{r}
# Subset the iris data set into the three species.
setosa_subset <- subset(iris, Species == "setosa")
setosa_subset
versicolor_subset <- subset(iris, Species == "versicolor")
versicolor_subset
virginica_subset <- subset(iris, Species == "virginica")
virginica_subset
# Display the last six rows of each species.
tail(setosa_subset, 6)
tail(versicolor_subset, 6)
tail(virginica_subset, 6)
```
6e. Create a scatterplot of the sepal.length and sepal.width using the different species(setosa,versicolor,virginica). Add a title = “Iris Dataset”, subtitle = “Sepal width and length, labels for the x and y axis, the pch symbol and colors should be based on the species.
```{r}
# Convert the "Species" column to a factor
iris$Species <- as.factor(iris$Species)

# Create a scatterplot
plot(
  Sepal.Length ~ Sepal.Width, 
  data = iris,
  pch = as.integer(iris$Species),  # Use different pch symbols for each species
  col = as.integer(iris$Species),  # Use different colors for each species
  xlab = "Sepal Width",
  ylab = "Sepal Length",
  main = "Iris Dataset",
  sub = "Sepal width and length"
)

# Add a legend
legend("topright", 
       legend = levels(iris$Species), 
       col = 1:3, pch = 1:3, 
       cex = 0.8, 
       title = "Species")

```

6f.Interpret the result.

The dataset consists of five variables (columns) and 150 observations (rows) in a data frame format. 

Petal.Length, Petal.Width, Sepal.Length, and Sepal. Width are the names of the four numerical variables. These stand for the measures of the length and width of the petals, respectively.
 
The factor variable Species, which represents the species of iris flowers, is the sixth variable. There are three tiers to it: "setosa," "versicolor," and "virginica," denoting the many iris flower species included in the dataset.

7. Import the alexa-file.xlsx. Check on the variations. Notice that there are extra whitespaces among black variants (Black Dot, Black Plus, Black Show, Black Spot). Also on the white variants (White Dot, White Plus, White Show, White Spot).
```{r}
library(readxl)

alexa <- read_xlsx("alexa_file.xlsx")
alexa

```
7a.Rename the white and black variants by using gsub() function.
```{r}

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Dot",
                        "BlackDot",
                        alexa$variation)
alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Plus",
                        "BlackPlus",
                        alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Show",
                        "BlackShow",
                        alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("Black  Spot",
                        "BlackSpot",
                        alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Dot",
                        "WhiteDot",
                        alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Plus",
                        "WhitePlus",
                        alexa$variation)
alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Show",
                        "WhiteShow",
                        alexa$variation)

alexa$variation <- gsub("White  Spot",
                        "WhiteSpot",
                        alexa$variation)

alexa

                       

```



7b. Get the total number of each variations and save it into another object. Save the object as variations.RData. Write the R scripts. What is its result?

Hint: Use the dplyr package. Make sure to install it before loading the package.

```{r}
library(dplyr)

variation_total <- alexa  %>%  count(alexa$variation)
variation_total

save(variation_total, file = "variations.RData")

```
7c. From the variations.RData, create a barplot(). Complete the details of the chart
which include the title, color, labels of each bar.
```{r}
load("variations.RData")

variation_total

variable_Names <- variation_total$`alexa$variation`

totalVar_Plot <- barplot(variation_total$n,
        names.arg = variable_Names,
        main = "  Total Number of Each Variations",
        xlab = " Name of Variations",
        ylab = "Total of Each Variatons",
        col = 1:16,
        space = 0.3,
        cex.names = 0.4,
        las = 2 )


totalVar_Plot

png(filename = "/cloud/project/RWorksheets#4B/totalVar_Plot.png", width = 600, height = 400)
dev.copy(png, "totalVar_Plot.png")

knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/RWorksheets#4B/totalVar_Plot.png")
dev.off()

```

7d. Create a barplot() for the black and white variations. Plot it in 1 frame, side by side. Complete the details of the chart.

```{r}
library(graphics)
black_variation <- variation_total[variation_total$`alexa$variation` %in% c("Black","BlackDot","BlackShow","BlackSpot","BlackPlus"), ]

white_variation <- variation_total[variation_total$`alexa$variation` %in% 
c("White", "WhiteDot", "WhitePlus", "WhiteShow", "WhiteSpot"), ]


par(mfrow = c(1,2))



black_Plot <- barplot(height = black_variation$n,
        names.arg = black_variation$`alexa$variation`,
        col = c("black","cyan2","brown2","limegreen","cornflowerblue"),
        main = "Black Variations",
        xlab = "Variants",
        ylab = "Total Numbers",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)



white_Plot <- barplot(height = white_variation$n,
        names.arg = white_variation$`alexa$variation`,
        col =c("black","brown2","limegreen","cornflowerblue","cyan2"),
        main = "White Variations",
        xlab = "Variants",
        ylab = "Total Numbers",
        border = "black",
        space = 0.5,
        cex.names = 0.4)
png("Black_White_Plot.png")

png(filename = "/cloud/project/RWorksheets#4B/Black_White_Plot.png", width = 600, height = 400)
dev.copy(png, "Black_White_Plot.png")
knitr::include_graphics("/cloud/project/RWorksheets#4B/Black_White_Plot.png")
dev.off()
```
